GitArista
=========

GitArista is simple git announcer for IRC Net with only basic functionality:  
- It can monitoring only one local git repository. 
- automaticly track of changes in you monitored git repository and show these changes in your defined irc channel
- also know one user command "last". So when GitArtist will be already connected to you 
irc channel try you type this: "gitarista: last"

Quick install:
1. Instal NodeJS + irc module
2. get git_announcer_auto.js from github
3. edit this script and update your custom settings
4. create new empty file in same directory: touch git_irc.log
5. to run: $ /usr/local/bin/node git_announcer_auto.js    
6. enjoy :)

I know, that there is big potentional for make improvements of my code, but on another site, there is no time :)
It was primarly created for personal use, but i know, that the situation with usable git announcer for irc is poor,
therefore, I also decided to public this my git announcer.
